          Images are displayed side by side in this example. The width and height are set to 100px for demonstration purposes. Adjust these values according to your requirements.

          The images are responsive and will adjust their size proportionally to fit the available space.

          You can replace the image sources with your own images.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
          You can also create a container div and apply the inline style to it to display the images side by side. This will make the images responsive as well.
      </p>
      <p class="p1">
          Note: The images in this example are placeholder images. Replace them with your own images to see the actual effect.
          The images are also cropped to maintain their aspect ratio. Adjust the width and height values to fit your needs.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
          You can also use CSS flexbox to display the images side by side. This will make the images responsive as well. Adjust the flex-wrap property to control the layout of the images.
          Note: The images in this example are placeholder images. Replace them with your own images to see the actual effect.
